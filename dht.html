<h1>Distributed Hash-table</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">Distributed hash-table</a>,
or <code>DHT</code>, provides an interface close to associative array or dictionary with key/value pair where storage of all pairs (key, value) is distributed into multiple nodes.</p>

<p>Thanks to such DHT’s characteristics as decentralization, scalability and fault-tolerance it creates an integrated space for service information storage. This means switching to absolutely different approach to organization of network infrastructure rather than common centralized client-server solutions.</p>

<p>Each computer running a BitDust program is a node in DHT network and stores key/value pairs created by other users.</p>

<p>BitDust software includes functional realizing DHT network by means of <a href="http://entangled.sourceforge.net/">Entangled</a> library – its source code is wholly included in the source code of BitDust and is distributed jointly.</p>

<h2>Data types</h2>

<p>Each user node uses different types of service data to interact with other computers in the network. Integrated space lets other users request any key/value pairs, which were previously written by the user in the DHT network, and get actual service information.</p>

<p>The following table has a list of command boxes, which can be written to the hash-table by each node:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>[IDURL]</code> 
user identity file stuff</p></li>
<li><p><code>[username]@[id-server]:address</code>
external net address in [IP]:[PORT] format for receiving incoming connections</p></li>
<li><p><code>[username]@[id-server]:incoming</code>
list of nodes trying to connect to the user at the moment</p></li>
</ul>
