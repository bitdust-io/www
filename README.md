# BitDust


## About

BitDust - is decentralized, secure and anonymous on-line storage, where only the owner has access and absolute control over its data.

Imagine a situation when two friends and you agree to help each other to store the data. On your computer you store the data that both of your friends uploaded to you via Internet, and you in turn can use the free space on their machines to save your files. This creates [redundancy](https://github.com/bitdust-io/docs/blob/master/storage.md), but allows storing important data in a safer way. It is also a fair deal, because all three are interested in the maximum safety and availability of stored information.

BitDust network is a voluntary association of people sharing resources of their personal computers. Their machines run the same copies of BitDust program, which enables device communication via Internet when data are transmitted directly from one user to another and stored on user hard disk drives. 

Uploaded input data is divided into blocks and fragments, [encrypted](https://github.com/bitdust-io/docs/blob/master/security.md) and uploaded on other users computers. The system is designed to perform continuous monitoring of each node, which stores your data.

The BitDust program constantly keeps a state, which enables you to download your data back to your machine at any moment. The mechanism of [automatic data restoring](https://github.com/bitdust-io/docs/blob/master/rebuilding.md) allows dynamic reassembling of the data fragments uploaded into the network on the new nodes without any action from the user. 

BitDust program is written in [Python](http://python.org) using [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/) Framework and is distributed in open source code - we are still deciding about the license type. 

The project is in the stage of deep development, but the demo version will be available in the near future. 

We invite all who are interested in this direction - primarily developers and enthusiasts. Join our [team](https://github.com/bitdust-io), or directly [support us](https://github.com/bitdust-io/docs/blob/master/donate.md). Together we will be able to create a fairer alternative and trusted solutions than existing global networks.

## Deploying

You can just open "index.html" file in the root folder of your local "www" repository and fully automated and independent copy of the web site will be rendered in your web browser. The web site do not require database to be avaialble on your host and only serve static HTML pages at the moment.

On the live machine serving https://bitdust.io resource "www" repository is cloned and direcly loaded into WWW folder maintained by Apache2 web server. When your "Pull Request" will be merged we will execute "./update" caommand to pull changes on the live machine.


## Contributing

This repository contains .html files generated from [BitDust documentation](https://github.com/bitdust-io/docs) sources built in Markdown format. If you want to modify any page on the web site, create a fork of both repositories on GitHub and clone it locally:

    git clone git@github.com:<your github username>/docs.git bitdust.docs
    cd bitdust.docs
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/bitdust-io/docs.git


You also need to have [bitdust.devel](https://github.com/bitdust-io/devel) repository cloned in the parent folder, because some of Markdown pages are generated from BitDust Python sources. So Makefile expects `../bitdust.devel` folder to be already existed:

    cd ..
    git clone https://github.com/bitdust-io/devel.git bitdust.devel


Next make a fork and clone BitDust web site repository:

    git clone git@github.com:<your github username>/www.git bitdust.www
    cd bitdust.www
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/bitdust-io/www.git


Also please be sure you have markdown2 package installed globally:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    pip install markdown2


Now you can start making changes in .md files of your local "bitdust.docs" repo. Save modified .md file and run `make html` in "bitdust.www" repo - a new .html file will be generated with fresh changes you just did in the corresponding .md file.

Then you can re-generate the whole BitDust web site locally that way:

    cd ../bitdust.docs
    make build
    cd ../bitdust.www
    make html


To put your changes in live you need to make two Pull Requests: first to bitdust.docs repo and second to bitdust.www repo. Commit and push your git changes to your bitdust.docs fork repository and start a [Pull Request](https://github.com/bitdust-io/docs/pulls):

    cd ../bitdust.docs
    make build
    git add -u -v
    git commit -m "some comment to describe what you did"
    git push origin master


Do the same for bitdust.www repository and start a second [Pull Request](https://github.com/bitdust-io/www/pulls):

    cd ../bitdust.www
    make html
    git add -u -v
    git commit -m "some comment to describe what you did"
    git push origin master


After your changes got merged you need to pull latest changes from upstream and push to your fork:

    git pull upstream master
    git push orgigin master


BitDust team is doing public code reviews and we will be in touch with you to go further. If you like the project, join [BitDust contributors](https://github.com/bitdust-io) on GitHub.
