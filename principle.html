<h1>How does it work?</h1>

<h2>Fully decentralized network</h2>

<p>The whole BitDust network consists of equal nodes, each one of which is both a client and a server for others. 
The user authorizes in the network by himself and safely interacts with others using his ID and a secret key. </p>

<h2>Distributed Data Storage</h2>

<p>Each BitDust network participant gets a chance to allocate his data on machines of other users, his suppliers. 
Uploaded data are backed up and organized into RAID array for ensuring possibility of their recovery. </p>

<h2>Automatic Data Recovery</h2>

<p>Each supplier gets a double portion of information: the data themselves in encrypted form and RAID-copy, 
which enables recovery by data loss. The whole process is done automatically and does not need 
any action from the user.</p>

<h2>User Information Protection</h2>

<p>All service packages have digital signature and personal user data are encrypted, using his secret key â€“ suppliers 
do not have access to them. Only having a private key you can restore the input data.</p>

<h2>Anonymous Network Log-On</h2>

<p>For network log on you do not need to pass through any authorization, leave email or phone number, 
there is no support team and BitDust company does not run centralized user information acquisition.</p>

<h2>Uses Distributed Hash-Table</h2>

<p>Distributed hash-table is used for service information storage, interconnection of users and maintenance 
of the network on the whole.</p>

<h2>Transmits Data by TCP and UDP</h2>

<p>Nodes in the BitDust network are connected to each other directly and data are transmitted using 
the protocols TCP and UDP.</p>

<h2>Users Connection beyond NAT</h2>

<p>There is a possibility of network connection of nodes which are beyond NAT and cannot receive direct 
incoming connections in regular form. In this case a distributed hash-table for service information 
storage similar to rendezvous point is used. </p>

<h2>Managed by Finite State Machines</h2>

<p>BitDust project is developed on the principles of automata-based programming and 
<a href="http://is.ifmo.ru/articles_en/">open project documentation</a>.
This is a programming paradigm in which a program or its fragment is represented as a model of 
some finite state machine.</p>
