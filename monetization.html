<h1>Monetization</h1>

<h2>The Idea</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Each participant in the  network can receive direct or indirect benefits from the provision RESOURCES of his own computer for other users</p></li>
<li><p>People who consume more RESOURCES than give will have to somehow invest their own funds for that would continue to use the services of BitDust society</p></li>
<li><p>Those who donates more RESOURCES  than consume will always be able to enjoy network for FREE</p></li>
<li><p>We started development of a kind of rating system, it is designed to balance and to sponsor active members who give RESOURCES to the BitDust network</p></li>
<li><p>Participants with great ratings will earn more than others</p></li>
<li><p>Users with "negative" rating, will have to contribute funds for that would continue to use the network as usual</p></li>
<li><p>Ratings will be collected for a certain period, such as a month or 50 days</p></li>
<li><p>After this period, all the statistics for this period is reset and all users start again from zero rating</p></li>
<li><p>Those who in the previous rankings were on the top (for example among the best 1-2%) receive "star", which remains in their profiles - is a sign of extreme reliability and trust</p></li>
<li><p>BitDust software will use a some kind of cryptocurrency - blockchain will store the key service information about all active nodes </p></li>
<li><p>Must always exist an opportunity to stay anonymous on the network without the participation in the rankings and publish IP address  and other personal data</p></li>
<li><p>Anonymous users can only count on the support of volunteers who give their free part RESOURCES your PC</p></li>
<li><p>Here are some parameters which forms the final rating of the user (this is a partial list, work in process):</p></li>
</ul>

<p>    * up-time of the node, the longer he continuously work in the network - the higher the rating he will have</p>

<p>    * amount of donated space on his HDD</p>

<p>    * the maximum bandwidth size of his network channel</p>

<p>    * the average volume of the network traffic for the reporting period</p>

<p>    * the amount of users which he supports - this is his clients</p>

<p>    * the number of failures from clients</p>

<p>    * the number of "likes" from customers</p>

<p>    * ratio of paid/unpaid customers which he supports</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Based cryptocurrency be implemented decentralized Exchange RESOURCES, where it will be possible to buy and sell computer RESOURCES</p></li>
<li><p>Those who consumes more than donates, can easily "invest money" to the whole community and "raise" its own rating to be able to stay connected</p></li>
<li><p>Those who supports the BitDust network a lot, will be able to "sell" part of their ranking in exchange for cash
    </p></li>
<li><p>BitDust company can make profits in various ways:</p>

<p>* A fully paid applications and services based on BitDust network</p>

<p>* A tax on each transaction</p>

<p>* In the form of resource users' PCs, which later can be sold to corporate and private clients</p>

<p>* In the form of advertising space for other companies</p>

<p>* Implementing additional functions to improve the software for private companies exclusively</p>

<p>* Accept donations</p></li>
<li><p>Employees of private and public companies, banks, etc. may use along with other network</p></li>
<li><p>Company BitDust may provide special conditions for corporate clients and create a network service that will benefit only those who have received authorization</p></li>
<li><p>BitDust Company may participate in the joint development of commercial products which will not belong to her, but only to use the kernel of the software</p></li>
<li><p>Program always comes on the user's machine in open source codes</p></li>
</ul>
